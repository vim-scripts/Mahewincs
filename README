I wrote this colorscheme, because I did not find one which pleased me. I also wished to have fun a little. I tried to be in a sence original and I could help myself to use many colors, and I couldn't help to wink at to my colors' country. Mahewincs is actually in the first version, it would change again, but the base will remain the same. I will  also add others colors' definitions for gui(Gvim) and otherslittle things to fix for next version.  

I hope it will be use by the other persons than myself, I will so be pleased.
